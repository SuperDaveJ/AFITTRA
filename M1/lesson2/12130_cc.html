<p>As you learned in Lesson 1, Technology Readiness Assessments are a one-dimensional measurement. They represent the technology maturity of a system at a static snapshot in time. They do not measure other factors such as integration readiness or combat readiness.</p>

<p>Let's consider now how the Technology Readiness Assessment process can be viewed differently by different players in the process. Remember, each person will bring their own experiences and their own perceptions to the table. This can cause them to view aspects of the Technology Readiness Assessment process through their own unique filter or lens of perception.</p>

<p>Since Technology Readiness Assessments are one-dimensional, it is important to take the experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of all of the Independent Review Panel Team Members and focus them toward the performance of the Technology Readiness Assessment process. The Independent Review Panel Lead is responsible for delivering a fair and accurate Technology Readiness Assessment. To ensure that this happens, he or she must see that all of the team members combine their expertise, but do not diminish their individual strengths and differences, which provide for a more comprehensive assessment. The end result should be a team consensus that the programâ€™s technology maturity was thoroughly and accurately assessed.</p>

<p>We all come from different corporate cultures which also influence our perceptions. Corporate culture infers different informational silos or disparate thinking with different things being measured. When different corporate cultures are properly brought together, they create a balance and produce a Common Operational Picture.</p>

<p>To illustrate the point of different perceptions, consider the metaphor that is provided by selecting the Student Guide icon.</p>
