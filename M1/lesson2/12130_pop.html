It’s the same information, but is processed differently and seen as different applications.</p> <p>The problem might be a perception issue (the way the function of the technology is perceived), rather than a technology problem (the technology, in fact, works correctly). The people involved are looking at the issue from different points of view, and don’t understand points of view outside their specific discipline.</p> <p>Within the TRA process, we need to determine which problems are a result of technological immaturity, and which result from oversight, lack of leadership, or lack of proper application.</p>";
