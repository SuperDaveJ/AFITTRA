<p>Critical Technology Element maturity is measured using a scale we call Technology Readiness Levels or TRLs. Technology Readiness Levels are determined by a panel of subject matter experts who are independent of the program. The determination is based upon objective technical data provided by the Program Manager. </p>

<p>The Technology Readiness Level rating scale used in the Technology Readiness Assessment process ranges from level one through level nine. Select each of the technology readiness levels on the chart to view its definition.</p>
