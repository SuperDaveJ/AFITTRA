<p>We have been talking about why it is important to assess technology maturity, but what does that term really mean? How do we define it? Technology maturity is a measure of the degree to which proposed Critical Technology Elements meet program objectives. It is a principal element to consider when determining program risk.</p>

<p>Technology maturity is measured in two environments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relevant environment</li>
<li>Operational environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Select each environment for additional information.</p>
