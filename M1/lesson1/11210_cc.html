<p>While there are many benefits to the Technology Readiness Assessment, there are some potential drawbacks that you need to keep in mind. Some people fall into the trap of believing that a Technology Readiness Assessment will protect against issues such as functionality or integration issues, which the Technology Readiness Assessment is simply not equipped to evaluate.</p> 

<p>Technology Readiness Assessments are a one-dimensional measurement. They only assess individual Critical Technology Elements, not the way the Critical Technology Elements integrate with each other, or within systems.</p>

<p>Technology Readiness Assessments also donâ€™t consider outside integration influences like system readiness levels and different points of view.</p>

<p>We can work to minimize these drawbacks by being aware of and taking into consideration information such as the way Critical Technology Elements integrate with each other and readiness levels during the Technology Readiness Assessment process. These considerations must be done consciously and deliberately because they are not part of or assessed by the Technology Readiness Assessment.</p>

<p>Remember, even though there are drawbacks to the Technology Readiness Assessment process, the value of conducting the Technology Readiness Assessment far outweigh those drawbacks.</p>
