<p>The Milestone C Technology Readiness Assessment is important because it reflects the resolution of any technology deficiencies that arose during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. This allows us to verify that all Critical Technology Elements have matured as planned. By Milestone C, all Critical Technology Elements will have advanced and will continue to be matured through established Technology Maturation Plans. Any new Critical Technology Elements that have emerged should be identified, and their maturation plans should be reviewed.</p>

<p>Milestone C also marks approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production for hardware systems and limited deployment in support of operational testing for Major Automated Information System programs or for software-intensive systems that have no production components.</p>

<p>Technology Readiness Level 7 or higher is the expected state of technology maturity at Milestone C, per Title 10 United States Code, Section 2366b.</p>

<p>Select the Definition, Description, and Supporting Information on the table to reveal the Technology Readiness Level 7 hardware maturity requirements for Milestone C.</p>
