<p>Now, letâ€™s look at the purpose that Technology Readiness Assessment does NOT serve.</p>

<p>While the Technology Readiness Assessment does provide a means for identifying risk, it is not the sole means for discovering technical risk. An early evaluation of technology maturity conducted shortly before Milestone A also helps evaluate technology alternatives and risks. The Preliminary Design Review and the Critical Design Review, performed during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase, are other examples of means used for assessing technological risk.</p> 

<p>The Technology Readiness Assessment also cannot predict future performance of a technology, nor does it assess the quality of the system architecture, design, or integration plan.</p>
