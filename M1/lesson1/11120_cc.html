<p>Title 10 United States Code, Section 2366a requires that technology in Major Defense Acquisition Programs has been demonstrated in a relevant environment (meaning a TRL 6 has been assigned) before Milestone B approval.</p>

<p>The law allows the Milestone Decision Authority to waive the certification requirement if it determines that such a requirement would hinder the Department of Defenseâ€™s ability to meet critical national security objectives. However, as stated before, this is rarely done. </p>
