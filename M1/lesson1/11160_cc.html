<p>In addition to the factors listed on the previous page, one of the primary drivers behind the Technology Readiness Assessment process is the need to standardize Air Force processes.</p>

<p>The standardized process seeks to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What is needed from the system and how do things need to work (within the platform, relevant, operational, and combat environments)? </li>
	<li>How is technology designed to function within those environments?</li>
	<li>And, how is technology maturity determined if there is not an understanding of the model from which the technological concept comes from?</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s take a more in-depth look at what is involved in understanding the model.</p>
