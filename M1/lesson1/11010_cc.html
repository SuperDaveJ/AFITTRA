<p>Welcome to the Technology Readiness  Assessment course! My name is Mr. Norman Crow. I will be your facilitator  throughout this course. Iâ€™ll guide you as you learn about how and why the  Technology Readiness Assessment is performed.</p>
<p>A Technology  Readiness Assessment, also commonly known as simply a TRA,  focuses on assessing the technology maturity of a proposed system prior to  integration in the Air Force. This lesson presents the foundational knowledge  for conducting a Technology Readiness Asssessment. In this lesson, you will  learn about the definition, purpose, benefits, and drawbacks of a Technology Readiness  Assessment, as well as the steps in the Technology Readiness Assessment  process.
