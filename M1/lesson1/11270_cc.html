<p>MSA Phase stands for Materiel Solution Analysis Phase. This phase has several functions. It assesses potential materiel solutions and satisfies the phase-specific entry criteria for Milestone A. Before this phase begins, a list of potential Critical Technology Elements is compiled. This list becomes what is called the Candidate Solution Sets Selection and Characterization and eventually evolves into a list of Concept Characterization and Technical Description for inclusion into the Analysis of Alternatives Study Plan.</p>

<p>Entrance into this phase depends on an approved Initial Capabilities Document. In this phase, an Analysis of Alternatives is conducted to identify potential materiel need solutions, based on a cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>Early Systems Engineering activities, such as the proposed Engineering Analysis of Potential System Solutions, are conducted. These materiel solutions then undergo an Early Evaluation of Technological Maturity, provided sufficient technical information exists to support such an evaluation.</p> 

<p>This evaluation will identify candidate Critical Technologies or Critical Technology Areas for each of the potential materiel solutions.</p>
