<p>The Technology Readiness Assessment process to supports two methods of milestone certification:</p>

<p>In the first method, to support certification, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics relies on the Director, Defense Research and Engineering to provide technical advice. The Director, Defense Research and Engineering provides similar technical advice to the Milestone Decision Authority to support certification of space programs and Major Automated Information System acquisitions.</p>

<p>For the Technology Readiness Assessment to become an effective basis for the Director, Defense Research and Engineering’s advice to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and Milestone Decision Authority’s, certain outcomes must be achieved.</p>

<p>With method two, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must testify to Congress the rationale for certification if a waiver is required per paragraph (c) of Title 10 U.S.C. 2366a.</p>
