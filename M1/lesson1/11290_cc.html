<p>A best practice is to use the results of this Early Evaluation of Technology Maturity
as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To provide a basis for modifying the requirements if technological risks are too high</li>

	<li>To support the development of Technology Maturation Plans that show how all likely Critical Technology Elements will be demonstrated in a relevant environment before preliminary design begins at the full system level</li>

	<li>To refine the Technology Development Strategy (Note that the results of the Director of Research Directorate review of the Early Evaluation of Technology Maturity will form the basis of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering’s concurrence or non-concurrence with the Technology Development Strategy)</li>

	<li>To inform the test and evaluation community about technology maturity needs</li> 

	<li>To ensure that all potential Critical Technology Elements are included in the program’s risk management database and plan</li>

	<li>To establish Technology Transition Agreements to articulate external dependencies on technology base projects and to define the specific technologies, technology demonstration events, and exit criteria for the technology to transition into the acquisition program.</li>
</ul>    

<p>The Early Evaluation of Technology Maturity conducted at or shortly before Milestone A helps evaluate technology alternatives and risks and, thereby, helps the Program Manager refine the plans for achieving mature technologies at Milestone B.</p>
