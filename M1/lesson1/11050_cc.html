<p>Now that you know what a Technology Readiness Assessment is, let's move into a discussion about why we perform Technology Readiness Assessments. What purpose does it serve? What purpose does it NOT serve? Let's look at the purpose it serves first.</p> 

<p>The purpose of a Technology Readiness Assessment is to perform an independent, objective assessment to ensure appropriate technology maturity is in place during each phase of the acquisition lifecycle and to assess the technical risk associated with a project. This is important because technologically immature development efforts often lead to cost overruns, schedule slippages, and performance problems, which are associated with the quality triangle elements.</p> 

<p>To understand this purpose, consider the 2005 Government Accountability Office review of 54 Department of Defense programs. This study was conducted to show the effects of moving forward in a program without having requisite knowledge at key decision points.</p>  

<p>In that review, the Government Accountability Office found that only 15% of the programs began with mature technologies. For programs with mature technology, research, development, test, and evaluation costs increased 9% and unit production cost increased less than 1%. For programs with immature technology, research, development, test, and evaluation costs increased 41% and unit production cost increased 21%. </p>
