<h2 class="topic_title">Important TRA Considerations</h2>

<div id="sec508">
        
<p>Text popups for each of the 10 selectable TRA steps on the left side of the page display on the right side of the page in a framed text area.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 1 - Initiate TRA </p>
<p>In this step, the PM has to develop the technical WBS for the system under development. The PM needs to be aware if new technology is being developed (at the MSA Phase or at Milestone A Technology Development Phase) for integration into his / her system. </p>
<p>The PM needs to be cognizant of decisions made via functional needs area, functional assessment area, and so forth, and how any of this and the Technology Development Strategy document or evolutionary acquisition might impact his / her acquisition program.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 2 – Plan TRA</p>
<p>The PM must derive a schedule for TRA Activities which include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Agreement between PM, SAF / AQR, and DRD.</li> 
	<li>Schedule for time needed to put together the IRP. Availability for this meeting can be a big factor.</li> 
	<li>Get concurrence with composition of IRP.</li> 
	<li>Time for IRP to establish CTE candidates.</li> 
	<li>Time for DRD to concur with CTE selection(s).</li> 
	<li>Time for the PM to compile evidence of technological maturity pertaining to CTE(s). </li>
	<li>Time for IRP to evaluate CTEs regarding TRL levels.</li> 
	<li>Time for IRP or PM to prepare TRA Report.</li> 
	<li>Time for SAF / AQR to send TRA Report to DRD. </li>
	<li>Time for SAF / AQR to endorse TRA Report to DRD.</li> 
	<li>Milestone Review Meeting.</li> 
	<li>Time to prepare the TMP, if required.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 3 - Identify IRP</p>
<p>Sometimes the DRD, who works for DDR&E may reject IRP candidates. When considering candidates for the IRP, the following suggestions may help you assemble the most appropriate group and save you the effort of selecting replacements for rejected candidates.</p>
<p>There are varying perceptions as to which criteria (academic / experience) should have the greatest weight during decision making. Selecting the person with a degree only may not bring the greatest benefit to the IRP.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that diversity of thought is implemented when identifying the IRP members. Because of blind spots or herd mentality, like-minded IRP members may not make best CTE selections. If everyone on the panel has the same opinion, critical items may be overlooked.  In our line of work, that could ultimately result in the death of a warfighter. Varying types of thinkers are required for success.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 4 - Train IRP</p>
<p>Training should include an overview of the system, an overview of the TRA process, criteria for identifying CTEs, and examples and instructions for applying the TRLs. (IRT members might also be required to sign non-disclosure agreements and declare that they have no conflicts of interest.)</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 5 - Develop Candidate CTE List</p>
<p>Using the most current system design, apply the CTE definition across the system’s technical WBS or system and software architectures to create an initial list of possible CTEs. This process should be thorough, disciplined, and inclusive. </p>
<p>Any questionable technology should be identified as a possible CTE. For these questionable technologies, the information required to resolve their status should be also documented. </p>
<p>The PM, the government program office staff, and the system contractors—the people best informed about the system—should lead the first step.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 6 - Finalize CTE List</p>
<p>The development of this list is the responsibility of an IRP. In doing so, the IRT, in conjunction with the PMO, resolves any issues generated in the development of the initial CTE list. The IRP can also make additions and deletions to the initial list.</p> 
<p>The DRD should also review the candidate list and provide necessary changes. Additions to the list may include any technologies that warrant the rigor of the formal TRA process.</p> 
<p>The first test to be passed is whether the technology is critical, as determined by a yes answer to question 1. The second test is whether any of the remaining questions can be answered with a yes. If so, then the technology is a CTE. A perceived high TRL does not preclude a technology from being a CTE.</p>
<p>The coordination process:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At this point, any disagreements on identifying CTEs should be resolved within the Component.</li>
	<li>A DRD concurrence of the CTEs should also be obtained so that any concerns can be raised early and addressed in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>   

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 7 - Collect Data</p>
<p>Perform the PDR, CDR, and Test Demonstrations in Relevant, Operational, and Combat Environments. </p>

<p>When you are finished with the reviews and tests, there may be trouble with the data and trouble interpreting the data; the clearance and classification must be considered; and you may have collected data that you don’t know the meaning of.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 8 - Perform Assessment</p>
<p>Once the IRP receives the data from Step 7, they will review it to determine if it is appropriate or if supplemental information is required.</p> 
<p>You will also review documentation for CTEs and score the CTEs based on criteria stated in DoD TRA Deskbook.</p>
<p>When the IRP lead has agreement amongst the entire IRP, the group will begin writing the TRA Report.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 9 - Document TRA</p>
<p>For the format on how to write a TRA Report, see Skeletal Template for a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Submission, DoD TRA Deskbook, pp. A-3 thru A-6. </p>
<p>The PM will be tasked to write the TRA Report.</p> 
<p>If within Milestone B already and the CTE(s) are of high interest to DRD but also determined to be immature, the PM and Contractor counterpart will also be tasked to write TMPs.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Step 10 - Staff TRA</p>
<p>When the report is finalized, the PMO sends it to SAF / AQR. SAF / AQR sends the document to multiple groups to review for purpose of attaining multiple points of view. </p>
<p>IRP Lead and PM must remain available to brief SAF / AQR, DRD, and others about the findings. </p>
<p>A positive or negative decision for the TRA Report and respective CTE(s) is / are stated in an SAF / AQR Memorandum for Record which is then submitted to SAF / AQ and DRD. This is a peer review, even though the wording sounds as if it’s another IRP.</p>
