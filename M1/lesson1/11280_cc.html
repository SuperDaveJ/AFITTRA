<p>The key differences between the Early Evaluation of Technology Maturity at Milestone A and the Milestone B Technology Readiness Assessment are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the Early Evaluation of Technology Maturity, the Independent Review Panel should include system-level generalists in addition to SMEs. This evaluation is not a replacement for the Milestone B Technology Readiness Assessment.</li>

	<li>The candidate Critical Technology Element list should be based upon information from Broad Agency Announcements, Requests for Information, market surveys, actual results from government- or industry-funded efforts, and any initial system design concepts being considered by the program office.</li>

	<li>Because multiple design / technology options may be available early in the program, the Program Manager should develop a potential Critical Technology Element list that includes technologies associated with all the options. The Independent Review Panel should use its collective expertise to review and refine this list and determine a preliminary technology maturity assessment, without using Technology Readiness Levels, for each Critical Technology Element based on requirements and environments specified in the Initial Capabilities Document or draft Capability Development Document.</li>

	<li>The Early Evaluation of Technology Maturity should be signed off by the Component Science and Technology Executiveâ€™s office and sent directly to the Director, Research Directorate. The Director of Research Directorate review will be forwarded to the Program Manager, the relevant Overarching Integrated Product Team, and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.</li>
</ul>
