<p>The Government Accounting Office reports show that most programs are still concurrently developing technologies, finalizing designs, and demonstrating manufacturing processes that lead to cost and schedule inefficiencies and avoidable re-work.</p>

<p>Performing a Technology Readiness Assessment at the beginning of the process (rather than concurrently) would greatly reduce the cost and schedule inefficiencies and re-work experienced in programs today.</p>  

<p>To effectively measure the benefit of Technology Readiness Assessment, architectures must be developed and modeled to create new systems and deploy new technologies. The Department of Department Architecture Framework states that architectures provide a repeatable method for doing this when dealing with large organizations employing sophisticated systems and technologies in pursuit of joint missions. The ability to register architectures, communicate and share data across architectures, and link architectures will enable the future assessment of interoperability, identification of duplication and gaps, and determine reusability. </p>

<p>Because the Air Force is in the stages of building these architectures in order to facilitate measurements, accurate statistics donâ€™t currently exist.</p>
