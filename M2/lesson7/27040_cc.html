<p>The program manager’s task of collecting relevant data to supply to the independent review panel requires a great amount of review. The nature of the data collected relates to tests conducted on the component or subsystem to include descriptions, environments, and results within the context of the system’s operational requirements.</p>

<p>All right Major Cooper, I think I’ve accumulated a good amount of information regarding the radar system critical technology elements that we’ve identified.</p>
<p>
I have researched descriptions concerning the tests that have been conducted on the elements, the environments that they’ve been tested in, and the results of the tests. This information includes the type of equipment that was used for the tests and failure points for the various elements.

<p>That’s great Ms. O’Neil. You’ve certainly helped me and the team out with our task. We’ll be able to take that data and see how much effort it will take to ensure that each of the elements is matured enough to support the program’s goals.
