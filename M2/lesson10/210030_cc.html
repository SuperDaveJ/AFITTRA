<p>The Component Science and Technology Executive performs a peer review of the Technology Readiness Assessment Report and indicates in a cover letter any agreements or disagreements that he or she has with the findings of the Independent Review Panel. Once this has been done, the report is sent on to the Component Acquisition Executive for review, with an informational copy sent to the Director of the Research Directorate.</p>

<p>Next, the Component Acquisition Executive reviews the report and the Component Science and Technology Executiveâ€™s cover letter, and he or she also provides their agreement, disagreement, and rationale for any differences of opinion with an endorsed cover letter.</p>

<p>Then, the Technology Readiness Assessment Report along with both of the endorsed cover letters is submitted to the Director of the Research Directorate for review and evaluation.</p>
