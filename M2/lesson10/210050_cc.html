<p>Once the Director of the Research Directorate has evaluated the Technology Readiness Assessment Report and cover letters, an Evaluation Memorandum is prepared. Like the evaluation itself, the memorandum is prepared by the Action Officer. The memorandum should be signed by the Director of the Research Directorate and forwarded to the appropriate agencies at least 15 days before the milestone review meeting.</p>

<p>Dr. Nelson, I’ve prepared the Evaluation Memorandum for your signature.  After reviewing the results of the assessment, I felt that the Independent Review Panel did their due diligence and that all is in order.</p>

<br />
<p class="popupTitle">Dr. Mike Nelson</p>

<p>Very well. I’ll review and sign the Evaluation Memorandum and forward it to the Milestone Decision Authority.</p>
