<p>The Director of the Research Directorate will typically designate an Action Officer to lead the evaluation effort after receiving the Technology Readiness Assessment Report and endorsement cover letters.</p>

<p>The initial evaluation is done with the cooperation of the Component Science and Technology Executive and the Program Manager, with the outcome as either the Director of the Research Directorate’s concurrence or a request for revision.</p>

<p>After the revision, if the Director of the Research Directorate does not concur with the report, an Independent Technical Assessment can be conducted. This independent assessment should be a positive contribution to the acquisition program, and it should be conducted as quickly as possible—whether this requires one day or several months. However, the decision to perform an Independent Technical Assessment is rarely made.</p>

<p>As the designated Action Officer, I’ll need you to take the lead on evaluating the Technology Readiness Assessment Report that we’ve just received for the new ground radar system. Here is the contact information for Jennifer O’Neil, the program manager, and Cameron Vale, the Component Science and Technology Executive. They’ll be able to help you with any questions you may have.</p>

<p>Thank you, Dr. Nelson. I’ll get right on this evaluation.</p>
