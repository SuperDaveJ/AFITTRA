<p>It is the task of the Project Manager, Component Science & Technology Executive, and the Independent Review Panel Lead to build a successful IRP. However, just as with any team, success takes skill, time, patience, and awareness. The Component Science & Technology and the Program Manager hold an initial training briefing to bring the team up to speed on the Technology Readiness Assessment process and the program that will be assessed.</p>

<p>Hello, I’m Cameron Vale. The simplest explanation of the TRA process is that it identifies whether or not technology elements critical to the operation of a system are ready from a technological standpoint.</p>
<p>
You will be assessing the critical technologies that Ms. O’Neil and I determined; however, these aren’t set in stone. Maybe some of them aren’t as critical as we thought, or maybe we missed some. </p>
<p>
That’s where you come in. You’re the experts, and it’s by your determination that we’ll know we’re ready to progress to the next level of the program.</p>

<p>My name is Jennifer O’Neil, and I’m the Program Manager for the new ground radar system. I’m going provide some background information to you on the program. So far, we’ve identified eight critical technologies that will need to be assessed. As Mr. Vale stated, this is where we need your expertise.</p>
