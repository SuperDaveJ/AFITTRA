<p>All right team, it’s time for us to get down to business. Today, I would like to discuss our role in the Technology Readiness Assessment process and review the Technology Readiness Assessment Plan that Ms. O’Neil and Mr. Vale have put together. We will also review the subject technologies that we will be assessing and the tutorial provided for those technologies.</p>
