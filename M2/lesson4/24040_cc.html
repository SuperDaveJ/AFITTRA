<p>Our role is to assess the new ground radar system that the Air Force has decided to implement. As such, we will need to ensure that the system is ready to perform to the requirements set forth by the program. I expect that each one of you will contribute your technical expertise to the cause and that we will work together. This includes communicating with one another and working together to solve any problems we may encounter, individually or as a team, in a professional manner.</p>
