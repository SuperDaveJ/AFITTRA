<p>There  are five categories of environments which factor into Critical Technology  Element identification. These categories relate to both internal and external  environments of the system. The categories are physical, logical, data,  security, and user and use.</p>
<p>Select each of the environment  categories to view additional information, and then select the <em>TRA in Action</em> icon to view the next  segment of the TRA process scenario.

<p>define  the environment of the Critical Technology Element. When doing so, you will  need to ask some questions about the technology element.<br />
Key  questions that apply to all environments include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is  the physical / logical / data / security environment in which this Critical  Technology Element has been demonstrated similar to the intended environment?  If not, how is it different?</li>
  <li>Is  the Critical Technology Element going to be operating at or outside its usual  performance envelope?</li>
  <li>Do  the design specifications address the behavior of the Critical Technology Element  under these conditions? </li>
  <li>What  is unique or different about this proposed operations environment?</li>
  <li>Do  test data, reports, or analyses that compare the demonstrated environment to  the intended environment exist? </li>
  <li>If modeling and  simulation are important aspects of that comparison, are the analysis  techniques common and generally accepted? </li>
</ol>
