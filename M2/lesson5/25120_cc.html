<p>Before  we continue, let’s look at how the systems engineering framework plays a role  in the identification of Critical Technology Elements. Systems engineering  serves as the foundation of the Defense Acquisition Program, and as such,  provides the context for identifying Critical Technology Elements.  </p>
<p>Systems  engineering is defined as an interdisciplinary approach encompassing the entire  technical effort to evolve and verify an integrated set of system, people, and  process solutions that satisfy customer needs across the lifecycle of a system.</p>
<p>The key words here  are <em>evolve</em> and <em>verify.</em> The process of identifying Critical Technology Elements  seeks to both evolve and verify the technology element in question, making the  process inextricably linked to systems engineering.
