  <p>Text popups for the 8 selectable MSOB questions on  the left side of the page displays on the right side of the page in a framed  text area.</p>
  <p><strong>What is the definition of CTE?</strong></p>
  <p>A technology element is critical if the system  being acquired depends on it to meet operational requirements, and it or its  application is new or novel or in an area that poses major technological risk  during detailed design or demonstration.</p>
  <p><strong>What is  the difference between the 2 classifications of CTEs?</strong></p>
  <p>There  are two classifications that apply to CTEs: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hardware</li>
    <li>Software</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Technology  readiness levels are not assessed the same for hardware and software elements.<br />
    When  you are comparing the technology readiness levels for hardware and software  elements, there are similarities in the technology readiness level definitions;  however, the differences are shown in their descriptions and in the supporting  information required for each technology readiness level.</p>
  <p><strong>What are  the steps associated with creating a candidate CTE list?</strong> </p>
  <p><strong><em>Step 1: Create an initial list of possible CTEs</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Process</em></strong><em>: </em>This  involves applying the definition of a CTE to the system’s technical Work  Breakdown Structure (WBS) or system and software architectures.</p>
  <p><strong><em>People</em></strong><em>:</em> The program manager (PM), the government program  office staff, Component Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Executive, and the  system contractors<br />
</p>
  <p><strong><em>Note to Self</em></strong><em>: </em>It is important  that this process be thorough, disciplined, and inclusive. Any questionable  technology should be identified as a possible CTE. The information required to  resolve their status should also be documented.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Step  2: Develop a list of CTE candidates</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Process:</em></strong> An IRP,  in conjunction with the program office, resolves any issues from Step 1 and  makes additions and deletions to the initial list, as needed. The initial list  is also reviewed by the Director, Research Directorate (DRD)</p>
  <p><strong><em>People</em></strong><em>:</em> IRP, program office, and DRD</p>
  <p><strong><em>Note  to Self</em></strong><em>:</em> Additions may  include technologies that warrant the rigor of the formal TRA process. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Step  3: The coordination process</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Process</em></strong><em>:</em> Any disagreements for identifying  CTEs should be resolved.</p>
  <p><strong><em>People</em></strong><em>:</em> The IRP, the PM, the Component S&amp;T  Executive, and the DRD</p>
  <p><strong><em>Note to Self</em></strong><em>:</em> DRD concurrence  should be obtained in order to address concerns early and in a timely manner.</p>
  <p><strong>How do you  use the CTE questions framework?</strong></p>
  <p>If you can answer  yes to the first question and to any of the five remaining questions, then the  technology is a Critical Technology Element.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does  the technology have a significant impact on an operational requirement, cost,  or schedule?</li>
  <li>Does this technology pose a major  development or demonstration risk?</li>
  <li>Is the technology new or novel?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Has the technology been modified  from prior successful use?</li>
  <li>Has  the technology been repackaged such that a new relevant environment is  applicable?</li>
  <li>Is the technology  expected to operate in an environment and / or achieve a performance beyond its  original design intention or demonstrated capability?</li>
</ul>
  <p><strong>What is  the role of the systems engineering framework in CTE identification?</strong></p>
  <p>Systems engineering  is an interdisciplinary approach encompassing the entire technical effort to  evolve and verify an integrated set of system, people, and process solutions  that satisfy customer needs across the lifecycle of a system, and Critical  Technology Element identification applies to the Functional Analysis and  Allocation component of the systems engineering framework approach because it  uses the Requirements Analysis output to ensure the development of the  appropriate technologies.</p>
  <p><strong>What is  the difference between the two outcomes that the systems engineering approach  identifies?</strong> </p>
  <p>Functional  Architecture: The functional architecture describes what the system  accomplishes in quantitative terms; “What does it do?” It provides the  framework around which the physical architecture is designed and serves as the  basis against which the system and its various sub-elements are tested.</p>
  <p>Physical Architecture: The physical architecture identifies the subsystems and  components, both hardware and software, necessary to realize the system concept  and functional architecture. It is also the basis for design definition documentation  such as specifications, baselines, the system and software architecture, and  the technical WBS; items which serve the needs of the IRP during CTE  identification.</p>
  <p><strong>What  affect do environments have on CTE identification?</strong></p>
  <p>An  internal environment is derived from the performance requirements of the system  and is the primary environment used for identification and evaluation of CTEs.</p>
  <p> An external environment is natural or man-made, friendly or hostile environment  in which the system operates and is the secondary environment used for  identification and evaluation of CTEs.</p>
  <p> <strong>What is  the difference between the 5 environment categories?</strong> </p>
  <p><strong>Physical environment</strong></p>
  <p>Mechanical components, processors, servers, and electronics; kinetic and  kinematic; thermal and heat transfer; electrical and electromagnetic; threat  (e.g., jammers); climatic—weather, temperature, particulate; network  infrastructure</p>
  <p><strong>Logical environment</strong></p>
  <p>Software interfaces; security interfaces; Web-enablement; operating  systems; service oriented architecture(s); communication protocols; layers of  abstraction; virtualization; coalition, federation, and backward compatibility</p>
  <p><strong>Data environment</strong></p>
  <p>Data formats,  structures, models, schemas, and databases; anticipated data rates latency,  jitter, transit loss, synchronization, and throughput; data packaging and  framing</p>
  <p><strong>Security environment</strong></p>
  <p>Connection to  firewalls; security protocols and appliqués; nature of the cyber adversary,  methods of attack, and trust establishment; security domains</p>
  <p><strong>User and use environment</strong></p>
  <p>Scalability; ability to be upgraded; user training and behavior  adjustments; user interfaces; organizational change / realignments with system  impacts; implementation plan </p>
