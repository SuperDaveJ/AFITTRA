<p>Displayed  here is an example of the approach to systems engineering. The process input  feeds into the Requirements Analysis and makes its way to the Functional  Analysis and Allocation and then ultimately to Design Synthesis, which leads to  the process output.Â  </p>
<p>Critical  Technology Element identification applies to the Functional Analysis and  Allocation component of this approach. It uses the Requirements Analysis output  to ensure the development of the appropriate technologies which ultimately lead  to the desired readiness level that is then assessed within the design  synthesis component.</p>
