<p>Technology  readiness levels are not assessed the same for hardware and software elements.</p>
<p>When  you are comparing the technology readiness levels for hardware and software  elements, there are similarities in the technology readiness level definitions;  however, the differences are shown in their descriptions and in the supporting  information required for each technology readiness level.</p>
<p>Select the two  technology readiness level icons to compare the hardware and software  technology readiness level definitions, descriptions, and supporting  information. </p>
