<p>It’s  really straightforward; the functional architecture describes what the system  accomplishes in quantitative terms. The physical architecture identifies the  subsystems and components for the hardware and software that are necessary to  realize the system concept and its functional architecture. By understanding  both, you can better assess a system’s level of readiness.</p>
