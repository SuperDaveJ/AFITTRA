<p>All  right team, we’ve reviewed the list that Mr. Vale and Ms. O’Neil compiled. Now,  what we have to do is make sure they covered everything and what they chose to  cover is relevant. We will be applying these questions to each identified  Critical Technology Element to make sure it meets the requirements. If you can  answer yes to the first question and to any of the five remaining questions,  then you’ve got yourself a Critical Technology Element.</p>
