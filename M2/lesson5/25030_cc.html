<p>Critical  Technology Element identification should happen during the Materiel Solution  Analysis phase. The results of the initial assessment should be reflected in  the Technology Development Strategy, which will be used to improve and exploit  Critical Technology Elements in subsequent phases.</p>

<p>Cameron  and I have put together an initial list of technology elements that we felt  were critical to the program. We’ve incorporated this list into the Technology  Development Strategy.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Cameron Vale </p>
<p>Some  of the elements we identified may not be as critical as we think, but we felt  they fit the criteria. Our goal is efficiency. We didn’t want to overlook any  elements that we’d have to revisit down the road, resulting in a hold up of the  program and a waste of resources.</p>

<p>Well,  identifying too many Critical Technology Elements can lead to wasted resources  too. If some of the Critical Technology Elements that are identified don’t fit  the definition, an inadequate amount of resources would be given to deserving  Critical Technology Elements, and the process would be hampered. But, I trust  the judgment of you both, so I’m sure the list you’ve compiled is adequate.</p>
