<p>In the event a  critical technology element does not meet the readiness level requirements  necessary to receive certification at a milestone, there are several  alternative options that can be sought.  </p>
<p>These options  include seeking alternate, mature technologies; delaying the milestone until  the technologies have matured; using evolutionary acquisition, whereby immature  technologies are transitioned into the program at a later date; or seeking a  waiver from the Milestone Decision Authority.</p>

<p>Since  the duplexer is at Level 5 instead of Level 6, how will this affect the  program?</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Cameron Vale </p>
<p>Well,  we could seek a number of options including getting a national security waiver  from the Milestone Decision Authority, but I don’t recommend that one. Our best  bet is to delay the milestone until we can successfully test the duplexer in a  relevant environment.</p>
