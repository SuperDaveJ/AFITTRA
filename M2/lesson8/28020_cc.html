<p>In addition to the  pre-assessment kick off meeting, the Independent Review Panel will take part in  meetings which provide pertinent, in depth information concerning the relevant  and operational environments. </p>
<p>These meetings  ensure that each member of the Independent Review Panel has an adequate  understanding of the requirements, identified capabilities, software and system  architectures, concept of operations, and concept of employment to properly  define these environments.</p>
<p>These  pre-assessment meetings also ensure that the Independent Review Panel has an  adequate understanding of the critical technology element design details to  enable them to evaluate how it will function and interface. Without such  understanding, a critical technology element cannot be assessed as mature.</p>

<p>Our role  here is to determine the readiness of each of the critical technology elements  that we will be assessing.</p>
<p>Using the data that has been collected for us, additional information provided  in our pre-assessment meetings, and a review of the elements, we will need to  determine if each element is capable of fulfilling its stated purpose and why  there is confidence that it will perform properly. </p>
