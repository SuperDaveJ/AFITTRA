<p>In a closed door  session, Independent Review Panel members determine the technology readiness  level and rationale for each element and record this information on score  sheets. Copies of the score sheets are provided to the Independent Review Panel  Lead and the Component Science &amp; Technology Executive.</p>
<p>Each member  provides his or her own technology readiness level recommendation and rationale  to the group for discussion and deliberation. When providing a recommendation  it’s important to take into account whether the testing was comprehensive for  the sample sizes and environments measured and whether the data for the  environments measured can be applied to other environments.</p>
<p>An opportunity is  also given to the Program Management Office to provide feedback on any critical  technology elements which require Technology Maturation Plans.</p>
<p>The Independent Review Panel Lead promotes  discussions to achieve consensus on the final score and supporting rationale  for a technology, but consensus is not mandated. In some cases, the Independent Review Panel Lead may have to make the decision on the final score, taking into  account the unique expertise provided by each Independent Review Panel member  weighed against the technology under consideration. Strong dissenting positions  should be documented.</p>

<p>I  gave the duplexer a technology readiness level of five because the data that I  reviewed reflected that only its components had been tested in a relevant  environment.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Captain Albert Rosenfield </p>
<p>I  don’t agree with your assessment. The data that I reviewed indicated that the  duplexer prototype itself had been tested in a relevant environment, not just  its components.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Major Dale Cooper </p>
<p>All  right, it looks like we have a hung jury as far as the technology readiness  level of the duplexer is concerned. We need to try to come to a consensus  though, so let’s discuss the rationale that you both used to come to your  conclusions, and we’ll see if we can resolve this difference of opinion.</p>
