<p>In addition to the  statutes that require critical technology elements to be tested in a relevant  environment by milestone B, there is doctrinal guidance that pertains to the  Request for Proposal process and technology readiness levels.</p>
<p>With this  guidance, program managers are able to weigh several options in terms of cost  and time while ensuring that the critical technology elements meet adequate  requirements.</p>
<p>Including the  technology readiness levels in the contract language also allows for the  communication of concerns regarding issues of deficiency, ambiguity, and  non-compliance. </p>
