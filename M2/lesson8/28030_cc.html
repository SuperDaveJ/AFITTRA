<p>Once it has been  determined that each Independent Review Panel member has an adequate  understanding of the critical technology elements, it’s time to begin the  assessment. Each member reviews, analyzes, and assesses the data and artifacts  to determine each element’s technology readiness level, and then documents the  results and rationale. The duration of the assessment period depends on the  number and complexity of the critical technology elements. </p>
<p>The assessment  consists of a series of meetings and takes place in a Program Management Office  provided facility, where the security clearance level of the attendees is  verified with the level of data to be presented. </p>
<p>During the  assessment, there are several factors that the Independent Review Panel takes  into consideration, and outside subject matter experts may be consulted to  augment the group’s knowledge.</p>

<p>I  think that we are making good progress with the assessment. The data and  artifacts that Ms. O’Neil provided contain the specifics that we need.</p>

<p>Yes,  we should be ready to begin the scoring process soon. I’ll be finishing up the  documentation for my last critical technology element today. Having the proper  data and very knowledgeable  subject matter experts have been a huge benefit to our assessment.</p>
