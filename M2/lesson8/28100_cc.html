<p>The reason that  technology elements must meet certain technology readiness levels at program  milestones, most notably Milestone B, is because of Title 10, United States  Code Section 2366b. This statute requires the demonstration of elements in a  relevant environment and legally applies to Major Defense Acquisition Programs,  but is also required of Major Automated Information Systems.</p>

<p>As  a group, we’ve determined that the ground radar system’s duplexer does not  fully meet the requirements necessary to be considered Technology Readiness  Level 6, which is where it needs to be for the upcoming Milestone B.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Cameron Vale </p>
<p>Really.  What readiness level did you determine it was?</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Major Dale Cooper </p>
<p>After  much deliberation, we determined that it is Level 5, but the good news is that  it is really close to achieving Level 6.</p>
