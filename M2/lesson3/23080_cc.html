<p>Select the <em>TRA in Action</em> icon to view the next  segment of the Technology Readiness Assessment process scenario.
</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Major Dale Cooper </p>
<p>As an Independent Review  Panel Lead, I manage the assessment effort and schedule. I strive for consensus  among the team members when performing the assessment, while trying to avoid  group-think. Each member contributes their individual view, and by doing so,  adds to the holistic view of the technology.</p>
<p>In addition to  communication within the IRP team, I must ensure a high level of technical  coordination and communication between the team and academic and business partners  for additional expertise. This helps ensure that Independent Review Panel Team  activities integrate with the overall direction and guidance from the Program Manager.</p>
<p>I also communicate  progress and upon assessment completion, sign the final Technology Readiness Assessment  document, and outbrief the Technology Readiness Assessment results to Mr. Vale. </p>
<p>Lastly, we are to  document and submit the assessment to Ms. O’Neil and Mr. Vale for their review. </p>
