<p>So, where  does the PM get Independent Review Panel candidates? They can come from various  sources, but some appropriate places to start are: Product Center-Engineering  Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Federally Funded Research and  Development Centers, Advisory and Assistance Services, or other Service  branches.</p>
<p>The Program Manager  provides all of the compiled Independent Review Panel candidate information to  the Component Science &amp; Technology Executive, who in turn, modifies the Independent  Review Panel list as necessary, and then approves the Independent Review Panel  Lead and members.

<p>On  the list of candidates you’ll note that they come from a variety of backgrounds  and organizations, but they all have expertise in some aspect of radar systems.  The attribute checklists will be helpful for selecting the most qualified  people.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Cameron Vale </p>
<p>Thanks  Ms. O’Neil. I’ll begin selecting members who I believe will best suit the needs  for your program.</p>
