<p>In  addition to the Independent Review Panel members, an Independent Review Panel  Lead will need to be identified. While the Independent Review Panel Lead will  need to have the same attributes as other team members, he or she should also  provide technical experience, leadership, and authority in the technology  element being evaluated.</p>

<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Cameron Vale </p>
<p>Ideally,  what we’re looking for with an Independent Review Panel Lead is someone who  possesses the ability to provide good organizational skills, leadership skills,  communication skills, foresight, empathy, and who can contribute a pragmatic  approach to the Technology Readiness Assessment process.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Ms. Jennifer O’Neil </p>
<p>I  can’t argue with that. With careful consideration of the criteria, I’m sure  that we’ll have a qualified Independent Review Panel Lead.</p>
