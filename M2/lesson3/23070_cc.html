<p>Now  that you know what goes into identifying the Independent Review Panel, let's  look at the roles and responsibilities of its members. Independent Review Panel  team members are responsible for a variety of tasks when it comes to the Technology  Readiness Assessment. Let’s get an understanding of some of those  responsibilities from a team member.</p>

<p>When I was  selected to be part of the Independent Review Panel team, it was required that  I complete the DAU CLE 021 <em>Technology  Readiness Assessment</em> course online.</p>
<p>I’ve never  been part of a Technology Readness Assessment before, but Ms. O’Neil and Mr.  Vale explained to me that my responsibilities would include working with the  other team members to finalize the list of critical technology elements that  they had identified earlier in the Technology Readiness Assessment process. We  are also responsible for identifying the technology readiness level for each Critical  Technology Element, as well as the basis for our assessment.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are to  document and submit the assessment to Ms. O’Neil and Mr. Vale for their review. </p>
