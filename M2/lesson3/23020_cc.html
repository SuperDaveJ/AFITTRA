<p>When  the Technology Readiness Assessment was first initiated, the Program Manager  provided the Component Science &amp; Technology Executive with recommendations  for potential Independent Review Panel members based on the program’s  technological needs. During the planning portion of the Technology Readiness Assessment  process, facts about the Independent Review Panel candidates were compiled that  included their biographical and professional information. However, there are  specific attributes that should be considered during Independent Review Panel  member selection.</p>

<p>The  most important aspect of a team member is that he or she is a subject matter  expert in a relevant field. As a subject matter expert, a team member will  serve as the authority for a given technological capability area and help to  enhance the team’s understanding of related processes new and old. To ensure  that there is unbiased thinking, the team members should be independent of this  program’s technology development. </p>
