<p>You’ll recall from earlier that the creation of the critical technology element list consists of three steps: Step 1, Prepare an initial list of possible critical technology elements; Step 2, Conduct a review to determine the final list of critical technology element candidates; and Step 3, Secure final approval of the list. </p>
<p>The finalization of the critical technology element candidate list will allow for the Independent Review Panel and those with oversight, such as the Program Manager and the Component Science and Technology Executive, to track the progression of the elements’ technology readiness. </p>

<p>All right, from the look of things, it seems that you are all in agreement about the list of critical technology elements that were identified previously. I thank you for your diligence in assessing these candidates, as do Mr. Vale and Ms. O’Neil. I’ll get this list over to them, and we’ll go from there.</p>
