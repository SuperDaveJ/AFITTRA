<p>Once the Independent Review Panel has identified the technologies they feel are critical to the program, the list is submitted to the Component Science & Technology Executive for review and approval. In the event there are any disagreements over critical technology elements, they should be resolved between the Independent Review Panel, the Component Science & Technology Executive, and the Program Manager.</p>

<p>After any disagreements are resolved and the list is approved by the Component Science & Technology, it must then get the approval of the Director of the Research Directorate. </p>

<p>Well, as I figured, the initial list that you two identified was sufficient without being too much. The team felt that all of the elements that were listed were critical to the system and worthy of a technology readiness assessment.</p>

<p>That’s excellent. It looks like now the only thing we’ll need to do is get the candidate list approved by Dr. Mike Nelson, the Director of the Research Directorate. I will contact him and provide him with the candidate list.</p>
