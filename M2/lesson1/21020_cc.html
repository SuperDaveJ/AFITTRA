<p>Title 10 United States Code 2366b sets the ground work for the  initiation of a Technology Readiness Assessment with the statement, “the  technology in the program has been demonstrated in a relevant environment”. </p>
<p>DoDI 5000.02 contains the requirements and procedures for ACAT  programs. For programs with critical technology elements, that are ACAT I, or  have the potential to become ACAT I, the initiation of a TRA is statutory, as  mandated by Congress.</p>
<p>ACAT II and III acquisition programs have a regulatory mandate that  requires the initiation of a Technology Readiness Assessment.</p>
<p>Select each directive  for additional information, and then select the <em>TRA in Action</em> icon to begin viewing a scenario that progresses as  we advance through each lesson in the Technology Readiness Assessment process. </p>
