<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Norman Crow </p>
<p>With the initiation of a Technology Readiness Assessment, the Program Manager  and the Component  Science &amp; Technology Executive will need to work  together to establish the schedule and budget for the Technology Readiness Assessment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Technology Readiness Assessment schedule will vary with  the program’s acquisition strategy and should take into account any source  selection or down-select activity. As a result, activity start points and  duration may vary greatly. The time varies as a function of Component  procedures. Larger programs typically take a full year or more. Smaller, less  complex programs normally require less time.</li>
  <li>The  Technology Readiness Assessment budget must consider all possible costs  associated with the Technology Readiness Assessment to include Independent  Review Panel member support, travel, contractor support, technology  demonstrations, assessment functions during the Technology Readiness Assessment,  conference fees, Critical Technology Element briefings, and other costs that  vary from program to program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  Component Science &amp; Technology Executive identifies SAF / AQRE and SAF /  AQRT action officers for the program.</p>
<p>The Program  Manager develops a list of potential Independent Review Panel candidates and forwards it  to the SAF / AQRE.</p>
<p>The  SAF / AQRE compiles Subject Matter Expert information for the Independent Review  Panel candidates.</p>
<p>Select each word  phrase, and then the <em>TRA in Action</em> icon to view the next segment in the Technology Readiness Assessment process  scenario.

<p class="popupTitle">Ms. Jennifer O’Neil </p>
<p>We’re  looking at about 15 months before we get to Milestone B, so we’ve got a good  amount of time to get everything in order as far as the Technology Readiness Assessment  goes.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Cameron Vale </p>
<p>estimate  that an Independent Review Panel of 5 to 10 people is going to cost about  $100,000.</p>
<p>For the action  officers, I have identified Mr. Jamie Guthrie from the Engineering and  Technical Management Division, as Technology Readiness Assessment process co-owner;  and Mr. Tony Spaulding from the Science and Technology Division, as the Air  Force Research Laboratory interface, for this program. </p>
<p class="popupTitle">Ms. Jennifer O’Neil</p>
<p>AThank  you for the action officer names. I’ll start working my way down the list of  budget items to research additional costs estimates and coordinate them with  Mr. Guthrie. $100,000 for the Independent Review Panel sounds about right</p>
<p>While we are on the  topic of names, I have put together a potential list of Independent Review Panel  candidates that I’ll forward to Mr. Guthrie, so that he can begin compiling the  Subject Matter Expert information. </p>
