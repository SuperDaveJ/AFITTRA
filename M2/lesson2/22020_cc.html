<p>As you  might expect, the planning stage requires the development of a Technology Readiness  Assessment plan, which will incorporate elements from the initiation step, but  we’ll get to that later. The development of such a plan begins with the Program  Manager hosting a kick-off teleconference. During this meeting, the PM is  responsible for briefing participants on the areas of the Technology Readiness Assessment  plan.</p>
<p>In addition to the Program  Manager and the Component Science and Technology Executive, the teleconference  includes representatives from the Secretary of Air the Force Capability  Directorate, and the Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition Center of  Excellence, as well as any other pertinent parties.</p>

<p>I’m  glad everyone could join us today. Mr. Vale and I have been discussing  preliminary scheduling, budget concerns, and potential subject matter experts  to include in our Independent Review Panel. Our main focus is going to be the  new ground radar system.</p>
