<h2 class="topic_title">TRA Report Sections</h2>

<div id="sec508">

<p>Text popups for the TRA Report sections on the left side of the page display on the right side of the page in a framed text area.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">1.0 Purpose of this document</p>
<p>This section provides a short introduction that includes the program name, the system name if different from the program name, and the milestone or other decision point for which the TRA was performed.</p> 
<p>For example, “This document presents an independent TRA for the UH-60M helicopter program in support of the Milestone B decision. The TRA was performed at the direction of the Army S & T Executive.”</p>
<p><span class="pmo">Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR):</span> PMO</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">2.1 Program objective</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 2.0 Program Overview. It states what the program is trying to achieve (e.g., new capability, improved capability, lower procurement cost, reduced maintenance or manning, and so forth). It refers to the Capability Development Document (CDD) (for Milestone B) or the Capability Production Document (CPD) (for Milestone C) that details the program objectives.</p>
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> PMO</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">2.2 Program description</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 2.0 Program Overview. It briefly describes the program or program approach—not the system. It also explicitly identifies the increments covered by the TRA, if relevant.</p>
<p>This section answers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Does the program provide a new system or a modification to an existing operational system?</li>
	<li>Is it an evolutionary acquisition program? If so, what capabilities will be realized by increment?</li>
	<li>When is the Initial Operational Capability (IOC)?</li>
	<li>Does it have multiple competing prime contractors?</li>
	<li>Into what architecture does it fit?</li>
	<li>Does its success depend on the success of other acquisition programs?</li>
</ul>    
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> PMO</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">2.3 System description</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 2.0 Program Overview. It describes the overall system, the major subsystems, and components to give an understanding of what is being developed and to show what is new, unique, or special about them.</p>
<p>
This information should include the systems, components, and technologies that will later be declared CTEs. It also describes how the system works, if this is not obvious.</p>
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> PMO</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">3.1 Process description</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 3.0 Technology Readiness Assessment. It tells who led the TRA and what organizations or individuals were included as part of the IRP. It identifies the special expertise of these participating organizations or individuals. This information should establish the subject matter expertise and the independence of the IRP. </p>
<p>Members should be experts in relevant fields and should be sufficiently independent of the developers (government or industry) as to not be unduly influenced by their opinions or have any actual or perceived biases. To avoid being influenced by the PM, an IRP member should not be directly working for or matrixed to the program. Usually, the PM will provide most of the data and other information that form the basis of a TRA. Nevertheless, the assessment should be independent of the PM.</p>
<p>This section also tells how CTEs were identified (i.e., the process and criteria used and who identified them). It states what analyses and investigations were performed when making the assessment (e.g., examination of test setups, discussions with test personnel, analysis of test data, review of related technology, and so forth).</p>
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> IRP</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">3.2 Critical Technology Elements</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 3.0 Technology Readiness Assessment. It shows the technical work breakdown structure (WBS) or systems architecture and software architecture and the CTEs. It lists the technologies included in the TRA, and it explains the criterion for technologies that were included on the list of CTEs. It describes the environment that surrounds each CTE.</p>
<p>It can include a table that lists the technology name and includes a few words that describe the technology, its function, and the environment in which it will operate. The names of these CTEs should be used consistently throughout the document.</p>
<p>It also includes any additional technology elements that the Component S & T Executive considers critical.</p>
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> IRP</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">3.3.1 First CTE</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 3.0 Technology Readiness Assessment and its subsection 3.3 Assessment of Maturity. It describes the technology (subsystem, component, or technology), the function it performs and, if needed, how it relates to other parts of the system. It provides a synopsis of development history and status. This synopsis can include facts about related uses of the same or similar technology, numbers or hours breadboards were tested, numbers of prototypes built and tested, relevance of the test conditions, and results achieved. If the CTEs presented are in categories (e.g., airframe or sensors), the information specified should be provided for each CTE within a category.</p>

<p>It describes the environment in which the technology has been demonstrated and provides a brief analysis of the similarities between the demonstrated environment and the intended operational environment.</p>

<p>This section applies the criteria for Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), assigns a readiness level to the technology, and states the rationale for choosing this readiness level. It describes differing opinions for arriving at a particular TRL and the method of adjudication.</p>

<p>It provides extensive references to papers, presentations, data, and facts that support the assessments. It includes data tables and graphs that illustrate the appropriateness of key facts. These references / tables / graphs can be included as an appendix.
</p>
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> IRP</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">3.4 Summary of TRLs by technology</p>
<p>This section provides information for section 3.0 Technology Readiness Assessment. It includes a summary table listing the CTEs, assigned TRLs, and a short list of explanatory factors</p>
<p><span class="pmo">OPR:</span> IRP</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">4.0 Summary containing PMO’s response to IRP’s assessment</p>
<p>This section provides the PMO’s thoughts concerning the information provided in the assessment by IRP.</p>
