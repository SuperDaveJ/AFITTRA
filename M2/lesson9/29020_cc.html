<p>There are four steps associated with documenting a technology readiness assessment. During step one, the Independent Review Panel documents its assessment in accordance with section three of the Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook. In step two, the Independent Review Panel Lead submits the assessment to the Program Management Office and sends a copy to the Component Science and Technology Executive. In step three, the Program Management Office builds the Technology Readiness Assessment Report final document around the Independent Review panel’s assessment. Lastly, in step four, the Program Management Office and the Independent Review Panel Lead sign the Technology Readiness Assessment Report final document.</p>

<p>Thank you, Major Cooper. I’ll use the assessment to build the final report document and coordinate with you when I’m finished with it. We’ll both sign it, and then forward it to Mr. Vale for him to review and attach his cover letter.</p>
